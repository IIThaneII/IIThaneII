* Inline CSS
- In the body tag.
- Have to change the style of the element in each line.

* Internal CSS
- Between the head tags.
- Change all the style of the elements in that file but hard to reuse.

* External CSS
- New file of CSS.
- Change all the style of the elements in all files which link to this file.

Priority
Inline CSS > Internal CSS > External CSS.

* CSS syntax
selector {property:value;}

* ID selector
- Only one id can be named for that element and id > tag (more specific).

* CLASS selector
- Can named for many elements in order to group them and select CSS for them (can use many classes in one element).

* Pseudo-class selector
- Go to bacon image CSS to check.

* <div> </div> tag
- Create a box with margin, border, padding and the main box contain elements.

* <span> </span> tag
<p>a data <span class="sci">science</span> student.</p>
.sci {
    text decoration: underline;
}
==> use span to css a specific part of a paragraph.

* Inline element // does not take up all the space.
<span></span>, <img></img>, <a></a>.

* CSS display property
- display: inline; // makes all elements in one line (cannot change the width).
- display: block; // makes all elements in one block (can change the width but not in the same line).
- display: inline-block; // do both things.
- display: none; // makes the element disappear in the screen (can use in quiz).
- visibility: hidden; // just hide the element and keep the background stay still.

* CSS Position
- Static positioning is the default position of HTML with children sit on parents rule and order from the top to the bottom.
- Relative positioning is add the margin to the element from where it should have been. ==> only change the position of that element and doesn't affect other elements.
eg: img {
    position: relative;
    left: 30px; 
} // moves the image to the left 30px from the default position. 
- Absolute positioning is add the margin to its parent element.
- Fixed positioning is stick the element to one position (it will stay the same when you scroll).
